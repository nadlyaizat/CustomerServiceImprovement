# Support Ticket Analysis

## Aim

The aim of this project is to identify common support ticket trends and improve support processes. By analyzing a dataset of support tickets, we aim to gain insights into recurring ticket types and issues, which will help in targeting improvements to reduce ticket volume and resolution time.

## Introduction

In today's customer-centric business landscape, efficient and effective support services are crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction and loyalty. To achieve this, organizations need to identify common support ticket trends and continuously improve their support processes.

This analysis follows the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) framework to understand the dataset, handle missing values, explore ticket types and issues, investigate resolution time, and identify factors influencing longer resolution times. By leveraging data-driven insights, organizations can proactively address customer concerns, streamline support processes, and provide a seamless support experience.

## Key Findings

### Ticket Types and Issues

The most common ticket types are refund requests, technical issues, and cancellation requests. The recurring ticket issues include refund requests, software bugs, product compatibility, and delivery problems.

### Ticket Volume Over Time

Ticket volume fluctuates, with notable spikes and low periods. These trends can guide resource allocation, planning, and process improvement.

### Average Resolution Time

The average time to resolution is approximately 5.6 minutes. Further analysis against industry standards or predefined SLAs can help assess the efficiency of the support process.

### Distribution of Resolution Time

Most tickets are resolved within a short timeframe, but some outliers indicate longer resolution times. Analyzing factors contributing to longer resolution times can guide process improvements.


### Ticket Priority and Resolution Time

Ticket priority affects resolution time, with higher priority tickets often requiring more time for resolution. Evaluating ticket prioritization criteria can optimize support processes.

## Conclusion

By addressing common ticket trends, optimizing resolution times, prioritizing high-priority tickets, and adopting effective practices, organizations can reduce ticket volume, improve resolution time, and enhance overall customer support. Continuous monitoring and analysis of ticket trends, resolution times, and customer feedback are crucial for ongoing support process improvements.
